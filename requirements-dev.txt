# Dev tooling for harness tasks (uv-friendly)
#
# Primary source of truth for dependencies is:
#   - pyproject.toml
#   - uv.lock
#
# This file exists for compatibility with environments that prefer:
#   uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# or:
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# NOTE: App/runtime deps are managed via pyproject.toml; this file is for
# developer tooling only.
