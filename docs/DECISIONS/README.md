# Decisions (ADRs)

This folder holds Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Use ADRs when you: - change an architectural boundary - change a public
contract/invariant - introduce a new dependency with meaningful
tradeoffs - perform data migrations or security-relevant changes

## How to add a decision

1.  Copy `ADR_TEMPLATE.md` to `ADR-YYYYMMDD-short-title.md`.
2.  Fill it out in a concise, decisive way.
3.  Link the ADR in relevant docs (`DESIGN.md`, `CONTRACTS.md`) if
    applicable.

ADRs should be short enough to read quickly and specific enough to
prevent future re-litigation.
