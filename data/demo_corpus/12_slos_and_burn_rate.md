# SLOs and Burn Rate

## Why SLOs
SLOs create a shared reliability target and define what "good" looks like.

## Example SLO
Availability SLO for Cloud Run:
- successful responses / total responses over a 28-day window.

## Burn rate alerts
Use fast + slow burn alerts:
- fast detects acute incidents
- slow detects chronic degradation
